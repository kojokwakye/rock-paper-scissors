# [rock-paper-scissors](https://kojokwakye.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game rock-paper-scissors using html, CSS, and javascript.

## Summary & Gameplay

1.The game allows the player to select one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer also makes a random selection. The following rules determine the winner of each round:

    rock beats scissors
    paper beats rock
    scissors beat paper

3.The project utilizes html to structure the page, some "basic" css and js for the game logic. The js code handles the random selections of the computer choices, determines the winner of each round, updates the scores, and manages the display of the results.

2.The player and computer scores are updated based on the outcome of each round. The game continues until either the player or computer reaches a score of 3 after 5 rounds.

3.To play the game, simply open the webpage in a web browser and click on the rock, paper, or scissors buttons to make your selection. The game will display the choices, update the scores, and declare the winner after each round. Enjoy the game!
